# Overview

Roomier is a platform designed to connect you with your next roommate. Sign up for an account and begin creating posts to advertise your current or future housing accommodations, or browse the number of open requests for roommates from other users like you. If you find something you like, apply directly in app and other users will be sent your name, email and which location post you're applying to. It's as simple as that!

# Getting started
1. Fork this repo and install dependencies by running command: 
```sh 
npm install
```
2. To run the application, run command: 
```sh 
npm run dev
```
3. Navigate to ```localhost:8080``` to view the app

4. You'll be asked to either sign in or sign up with our interface. 

5. Once you're in, feel free to peruse the site!

# Future Work

Currently the team is hard at work integrating a gallery component to allow users to post multiple images to their listings.
Soon, we'll start working on a filter option to narrow the scope of your nearby search results.
